Welcome to my personal website! I am Keru Chen, currently a junior majoring in Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I am set to receive my Bachelor of Engineering degree in the fall semester of 2025. 

My research interests span the field of artificial intelligence, including the theory and application of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning, robotics and LLMs. I have also worked on projects in computer vision and computational optical imaging.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sen Lin](https://slin70.github.io/) from Computer Science Department at University of Houston. I am currently a research intern at [Milab](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/), Westlake University, specializing in robotics, reinforcement learning, and large language-vision-action models.

You can find my CV here: [Keru Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/My_CV.pdf).

# Project
### Translation of Breast Cancer Cell Staining Images Based on Multi-Scale GAN
* Supervised by [Prof. Yan Yang](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1370/12577.htm) from School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University.
* Received the **National Second Prize** at the 9th National Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Innovation Design Competition.
* We used a U-Net with an added attention mechanism as the generator, a multi-scale CNN as the discriminator, and a loss function based on the Frobenius norm to balance the weights of each discriminator, all within the training framework of a Wasserstein GAN.

### Waveformer: A Transformer based EEG Sleep Stage Classifier
* Supervised by [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/ggwang/home)  from The Biomedical-Information Engineering laboratory of State Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University.
* Combined with deep learning and signal processing techniques, i.e. encoder block of Transformer, convolutional auto-encoder and wavelet transform to classify sleep stages using EEG, and reached a classification accuracy of 75% in a private dataset, the highest level in this course.
* This project and its report have been uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/CLIVERCHEN/Waveformer_EEG_Sleep_Stage_Classifier).

### Face super-resolution based on deep learning
* This project is participating in **National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition**.
* Supervised by [Prof. Jingang Shi](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/jingang) from School of Software Engineering, Xi 'an Jiaotong University.
* Improved [IDPT](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/182)(IJCAI 2022) algorithm and build web-demo based on Flask and Ajax according to the algorithm to realize face detection, crop and super-resolution restoration of a given photo.
